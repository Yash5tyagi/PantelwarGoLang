# Concurrency
Concurrency in Go, in simple words, means that you can have different parts of your computer program working on different tasks at the same time, a bit like having multiple workers in a kitchen. Each worker (or "goroutine" in Go) can perform its job independently and doesn't have to wait for others to finish. This helps make programs in Go run efficiently and use your computer's resources effectively, just like a well-organized kitchen with multiple cooks getting things done simultaneously.
